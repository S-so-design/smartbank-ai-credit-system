# 📌 AI Credit Pre-Approval System

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project simulates an AI-powered emailing system for U.S.-based F1 visa banking customers who do not have a Social Security Number (SSN) and therefore often face difficulty qualifying for a credit card. The system analyzes 2 months of mock transaction activity per customer—specifically income and spending data—and uses a rule-based logic to determine their financial eligibility. If eligible, the AI module generates a personalized email message recommending a credit card pre-approval based on their activity.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is strictly for educational and demonstration purposes. It does not access real banking data, send actual emails, or make legal credit decisions. All data is simulated, and AI-generated messages are displayed for mock output only.

## 🎯 Key Functional Goals

- Simulate mock user transaction data for F1 visa holders
- Apply rule-based creditworthiness logic (e.g., Income ≥ $1500 and Spending ≤ 80% of Income)
- Generate a credit decision label (Approved / Declined)
- Use AI (ChatGPT API or prompt-based logic) to generate personalized pre-approval emails
- Display results or save them for review
- (Optional) Build a simple Streamlit front-end to test inputs and view results

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies (To Be Used Later)

- Python
- Pandas (for data handling)
- ChatGPT API (for email text generation)
- Streamlit (for optional UI)
- GitHub (for version control and portfolio)
